            You won't believe how easy it is to make homemade pretzels. With this 2-ingredient dough, you can have fresh, warm, and golden soft pretzels on your table in no time. Keep the toppings simple with melted butter and coarse salt, or take things over the top with cinnamon sugar or Parmesan Cheese. A quick bath in a baking soda solution will create the iconic, chewy crust you love from a soft pretzel.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
                <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bring 6 cups of water to a low boil in a large pot. Add baking soda.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mix 1 cup flour and Greek yogurt together in a medium bowl until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a surface dusted with more self-rising flour, and knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Continue adding flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll each segment into a long, thin rope, 22 to 24 inches in length. Twist the rope into a pretzel shape by taking the two ends, twisting them around each other, then securing both ends side-by-side onto the center portion of the rope.
